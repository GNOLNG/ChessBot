# chess.com-bot-for-visually-impaired
This project addresses the lack of support for visually impaired users on chess.com by introducing a keyboard-operated bot. The bot enables players to navigate the board and make moves using arrow keys and keyboard input, while also announcing the opponent's moves audibly.
