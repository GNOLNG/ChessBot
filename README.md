# chess.com-bot-for-visually-impaired
This project addresses the lack of support for visually impaired users on chess.com by introducing a keyboard-operated bot. The bot enables players to navigate the board and make moves using arrow keys and keyboard input, while also announcing the opponent's moves audibly. This accessible interface eliminates the reliance on visual gameplay.
